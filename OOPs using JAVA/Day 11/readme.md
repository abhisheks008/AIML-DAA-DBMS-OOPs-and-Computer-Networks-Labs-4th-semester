### Problems given in the Assignment :

1. Create a “circle” class & a “point” class. The coordinates of the circle are given and used within the “circle” class as object of the “point” class. Display the area of circle. 

2. Create a class called Time, which has three private instance variables – hour, min and sec. It contains a method called add( ) which takes one Time object as parameter and print the added value of the calling Time object and passes Time object. In the main method, declare two Time objects and assign values using constructor and call the add() method. 
3. Create a class called Complex, which has three private instance variables –real and imaginary. It contains a method called add( ) which takes one Complex object as parameter and print the added value of the calling Complex object and passes Complex object. In the main method, declare two Complex objects and assign values using constructor and call the add() method. 
4. Write a program to define a class having one 3-digit number, num as data member. Initialize and display reverse of that number. 

5. Write a program to define a class Student with four data members such as name, roll no., sub1, and sub2. Define appropriate methods to initialize and display the values of data members. Also calculate total marks and percentage scored by student. 
6. Write a program to define a class Employee to accept emp_id, emp_name, basic_salary from the user and display the gross_salary.
7. Write a program to define a class Fraction having data members numerator and denominator. Initialize three objects using different constructors and display its fractional value. 
8. Write a program to define a class Item containing code and price. Accept this data for five objects using array of objects. Display code, price in tabular form and also, display total price of all items. 

9. Write a program to define a class Tender containing data members cost and company name. Accept data for five objects and display company name for which cost is minimum. 


10. Write a program to define a class 'employee' with data members as empid, name and salary. Accept data for 5 objects using Array of objects and print it. 

11. Define a class called circle that contains: 
```
• Two private instance variables: radius (of type double) and color (of type String), 
• Initialize the variables radius and color with default value of 1.0 and "red", respectively using default constructor. 
• Include a second constructor that will use the default value for color and sets the 
radius to the value passed as parameter. 
• Two public methods: getRadius() and getArea() for returning the radius and area of 
the circle 
• Invoke the above methods and constructors in the main. 
```

12. Write a program which will accept an integer from the user and pass the value to a method called PrintNumberInWord that will print "ONE", "TWO",... , "NINE", "ZERO" if the integer variable "number" is 1, 2,... , 9, or 0, respectively. 

13. Design a class named Account that contains: 
```
I. A private int data field named id for the account (default 0). 
II. A private double data field named balance for the account (default 0). 
III. A private double data field named annualInterestRate that stores the cur-rent interest rate (default 0). Assume all accounts have the same interest rate. 
IV. A private Date data field named dateCreated that stores the date when the account was created. 
V. A no-arg constructor that creates a default account. 
VI. A constructor that creates an account with the specified id and initial balance. 
VII. The accessor and mutator methods for id,balance, and annualInterestRate. 
VIII. The accessor method for dateCreated. 
IX. A method named getMonthlyInterestRate() that returns the monthly interest rate. 
X. A method named getMonthlyInterest() that returns the monthly interest. 
XI. A method named withdraw that withdraws a specified amount from the account. 
XII. A method named deposit that deposits a specified amount to the account. 
```

14. Write a test program that prompts the user to enter the investment amount (e.g., 1000) and the interest rate (e.g., 9%), and print a table that displays future value for the years from 1 to 30, as shown below: 
```
The amount invested: 1000 
Annual interest rate: 9% 
Years Future Value 
1 1093.8 
2 1196.41 
... 
29 13467.25 
30 14730.57 
```

15. Write method headers for the following methods: 
```
a. Computing a sales commission, given the sales amount and the commission rate. 
b. Printing the calendar for a month, given the month and year. 
c. Computing a square root. 
d. Testing whether a number is even, and returning true if it is. 
e. Printing a message a specified number of times. 
f. Computing the monthly payment, given the loan amount, number of years, and annual interest rate. 
```

16. Write a program that reads ten numbers, computes their average, and finds out how many numbers are above the average. [Use this keyword] 

17. Write a program that reads ten integers and displays them in the reverse of the order in which they were read. 
18. Write a program to demonstrate use of 'this' keyword. 

19. Write a program to demonstrate use of 'static' keyword. 
20. Write a program to accept value of apple sales for each day of the week (using array of type float) and then, calculate the average sale of the week. 

21. Write program, which finds the sum of numbers formed by consecutive digits. Input : 2415 output : 24+41+15=80.
