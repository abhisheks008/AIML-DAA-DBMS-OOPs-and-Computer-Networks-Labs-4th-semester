### Setup for JDK and VS Code :

**Supported Java versions**

The supported version for running the VS Code for Java extension and the supported version for your projects are two separate runtimes. To run VS Code for Java, Java SE 11 or above version is required; for projects, VS Code for Java supports projects with version 1.5 or above. For more details, refer to Configure JDK.

**Using Java runtime configuration wizard**

To help you configure correctly, we provide a runtime configuration wizard. You can launch the wizard by opening the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and typing the command Java: Configure Java Runtime, which will display the configuration user interface below.

**JDK Configuration**


Note: To configure multiple JDKs, see Configure JDK. To enable Java preview features, see How can I use VS Code with new Java versions

**Using VS Code settings**

Alternatively, you can configure JDK settings using the VS Code Settings editor. A common way to do this is setting the value of the JAVA_HOME system environment variable to the install location of the JDK, for example, C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-13.0.2. Or if you want to configure only VS Code to use the JDK, use the java.home setting in VS Code's User or Workspace settings.

**Installing a Java Development Kit (JDK)**

When you need install a JDK, we recommend you to consider installing from one of these sources:

- Oracle Java SE
- AdoptOpenJDK
- Azul Zulu for Azure - Enterprise Edition

**Creating a source code file**

Create a folder for your Java program and open the folder with VS Code. Then in VS Code, create a new file and save it with the name Hello.java. When you open that file, the Java Language Server automatically starts loading, and you should see a loading icon on the right side of the Status Bar. After it finishes loading, you will see a thumbs-up icon.

Note: If you open a Java file in VS Code without opening its folder, the Java Language Server might not work properly.

VS Code will also try to figure out the correct package for the new type and fill the new file from a template. See Create new file.

You can also create a Java project using the Java: Create Java Project command. Bring up the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and then type java to search for this command. After selecting the command, you will be prompted for the location and name of the project. You can also choose your build tool from this command.

Visual Studio Code also supports more complex Java projects, see Project Management.

**Editing source code**

You can use code snippets to scaffold your classes and methods. VS Code also provides IntelliSense for code completion, and various refactor methods.

To learn more about editing Java, see Java Editing.

**Running and debugging your program**

To run and debug Java code, set a breakpoint, then either press F5 on your keyboard or use the Run > Start Debugging menu item. You can also use the Run|Debug CodeLens options in the editor. After the code compiles, you can see all your variables and threads in the Run view.

The debugger also supports advanced features such as Hot Code replacement and conditional breakpoints.
